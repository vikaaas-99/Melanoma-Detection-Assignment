# Project Name
> Melanoma Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks
> Building a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
In this project, we aim to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to accurately detect melanoma, a type of skin cancer. Early detection of melanoma is crucial as it can be deadly if not diagnosed and treated promptly. By leveraging deep learning techniques, we can develop a solution that evaluates images and alerts dermatologists about the presence of melanoma, potentially reducing manual effort in diagnosis.
> Dataset
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).
- The dataset includes the following diseases: Actinic keratosis, Basal cell carcinoma, Dermatofibroma, Melanoma, Nevus, Pigmented benign keratosis, Seborrheic keratosis,     Squamous cell carcinoma, Vascular lesion.
- Images have been categorized based on the classification taken with ISIC, with a slight dominance of melanomas and moles.



## Conclusions
- The project aimed to develop a CNN-based model for accurate melanoma detection.
- Through multiple iterations of model building, training, and augmentation, we addressed issues such as overfitting, underfitting, and class imbalances.
- Evaluated the performance of each model iteration and discussed findings.
- The final model demonstrates improved performance in detecting melanoma and shows promise for assisting dermatologists in diagnosing skin cancer.
